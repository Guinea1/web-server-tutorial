# Debian 11 Simple Apache Web Server Tutorial
### Bobby D

This is a simple tutorial on how to setup a simple Apache web server on Debian 11, it will walk you through:

1. Getting a cloud server (**VPS**) with a public IP
2. Accessing that server via **SSH**, and updating it
3. Ensuring Port 80 (HTTP) is publicly accessible
4. Installing the Apache service and starting/enabling it
5. Editing/Changing the hosted **HTML** page

This tutorial **WILL NOT** cover aspects such as setting up a domain name, SSL (HTTPS), or something more advanced like installing Wordpress.

The tutorial is mostly target towards those who only want to host a static website (though, admittedly there are simpler free ways of doing this), those who know how to edit/create HTML to make a webpage, as well as those who may just want to learn more about running a server on Linux.
